# Neo
#### Exit the Matrix with the one true Craft field type

Neo is a [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) field type that builds upon the concept of the [Matrix field type](https://craftcms.com/features/matrix) with a bunch of cool new features. Neo is built from the ground up, and in the classic style of Craft, so as to feel like it's native to the core product.
