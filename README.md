# Neo
#### Exit the Matrix with the one true Craft field type

Neo is a [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) field type that builds upon the concept of the [Matrix field type](https://craftcms.com/features/matrix) with a bunch of cool new features. Neo is built from the ground up, and in the classic style of Craft, so as to feel like it's native to the core product.

## Features

- **Use existing fields for your block types**
- Add tabbed field sections on your block types
- Create block type groups for a cleaner UI
- Set a maximum count for individual block types
- **Create heirarchy by allowing blocks types to nest other specific block types**
- **Full support for [Reasons](https://github.com/mmikkel/Reasons-Craft), [Relabel](https://github.com/benjamminf/craft-relabel) and [Quick Field](https://github.com/benjamminf/craft-quick-field) plugins**

## Release

Neo is currently in alpha, so feel free to try it out! Keep in mind that breaking changes are to be expected with later releases, without migration. Point is, don't use it in production quite yet.
