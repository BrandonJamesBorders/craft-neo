# Neo
#### A Matrix-like field type that uses existing fields

This is the Craft 3 development branch. The plugin is currently under heavy development so do not use it in your projects.


### State of the project
##### 30th August 2018
Hello All,

Spicy Web has taken over ownership of the Neo plugin, Ben has moved on and wanted the plugin to be looked after, which we are honoured to do.

Spicy Web uses Neo in all our websites like many of you, so we just wanted to officially say the plugin will be supported and it will be updated to Craft 3 ASAP.

We have set ourselves a goal to have it Craft 3 ready by October 30.

Thank you

Tony Sambell

Spicy Web Director
